Feel free to post pull request, report issues, or request new features!

To modify and develop **markdown-preview-enhanced** package, you need to perform [local installation](installation.md?id=install-from-github).

After you have done installing the package, follow these steps:

- Open **markdown-preview-enhanced** folder in **Atom Editor** from **View->Developer->Open in Dev Mode...**
- Then you can modify the code.
  Every time after you update the code, you need to <kbd>cmd-shift-p</kbd> then choose `Window: Reload` to reload the package to see the update.

> As the Atom version is written in TypeScript, it is recommended to install `atom-typescript` to help develop the package.  
> Well... I developed the atom version using vscode.

## Develop this package for VS Code

Clone [vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/vscode-markdown-preview-enhanced), then `yarn install`, open in **vscode** and start debugging.
